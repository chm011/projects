I had two different questions for the deceptive and earnest visualizations: “What does internet usage across the continent look like?” and “Has internet usage changed throughout the years?”

The design rationale behind the earnest visualization was to accurately present the trends in internet usage across the main continents over time. I chose to use a line graph as I believe it most effectively shows time-series data and trends for this dataset. It highlights the progression of how the average number of users increased from 2000 and clearly shows which continent had a higher percentage of users initially. In other words, it provides a clear picture of how quickly the internet has become common in different regions. For the design, I used different colors for each continent, a 0-100% scale on the Y-axis, and years on the X-axis. I believe this makes it more visually appealing and easier for readers to follow.

The design rationale for the deceptive visualization was to confuse readers into thinking that internet usage is similar across all continents. I chose a Gantt bar chart with a logarithmic Y-axis to distort the perception of internet adoption across regions, as mentioned earlier, and to minimize differences between higher and lower values. This makes the gap in internet progression harder to notice. The Gantt chart also makes it difficult for readers to identify trends, as each year is shown as an individual line, fragmenting the pattern throughout. It gives the false impression that Africa's internet growth is similar to that of the Americas, when in reality it is not. Additionally, I chose a color scale with similar hues for each year to further obscure the differences.
