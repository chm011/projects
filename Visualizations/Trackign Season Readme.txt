This visualization shows the amount of rainfall and sunshine each major city experiences throughout the year. I chose to plot sunshine on the left Y-axis and rainfall on the right Y-axis to illustrate how these two variables change together from January to December, moving left to right across the chart. The use of dual-axis line charts allows us to observe seasonal trends in both sunshine and rainfall simultaneously. For example, in San Francisco, the summer months bring the most sunshine with little rainfall, while in a city like Chicago, both sunshine and rainfall increase as the summer progresses. This visualization helps to reveal the distinct weather patterns of each city.

The color choices are deliberate: orange represents sunshine, reflecting the color of the sun, while blue represents rainfall, associating it with water. These intuitive colors make it easier for viewers to quickly identify what each line represents, even without referring to the legend. The line graph format was chosen for its simplicity, making it easy to follow and visually identify trends. Additionally, the visualization is organized into a facet grid, with each city having its own plot to prevent overcrowding and to clearly distinguish between them. This design provides a clear, intuitive view of how different cities experience varied seasonal changes in weather, and how sunshine and rainfall can shift together or independently throughout the year.
